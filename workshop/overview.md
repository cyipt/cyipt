# Prioritising cycling infrastracture: new tools and datasets for the LCWIP process

## Introduction

The Government is urging highway authorities in England (outside London) to develop Local Cycling Infrastructure Plans (LCWIPs), as part of its Cycling and Walking Investment Strategy (CWIS).
A range of new datasets and tools can inform these plans, to ensure that they are evidence-based, cost-effective and prioritised such that the infrastructure that goes in first is the infrastructure that is most urgently needed.

This workshop will provide an overview of new open access datasets and freely available tools that can help with the process based on work conducted as part of the DfT-funded Cycling Infrastructure Prioritisation Toolkit (CyIPT).
The workshop will provide information about how the CyIPT and existing tools such as the Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT) can assist with the LCWIP process.
There will be a substantial practical component that can contribute to CPD objectives, and networking opportunities with the academics who developed the CyIPT, DfT representatives, and other local authorities.
