## The scale of the challenge, from this...

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
options(htmltools.dir.version = FALSE)
library(RefManageR)
BibOptions(check.entries = FALSE, 
           bib.style = "authoryear", 
           cite.style = 'alphabetic', 
           style = "markdown",
           first.inits = FALSE,
           hyperlink = FALSE, 
           dashed = FALSE)
my_bib = ReadBib("/home/robin/h/allrefs.bib", check = FALSE)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# save pdf

Any ideas which city this is?

## Problem: evidence overload

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://larrycuban.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/data-overload-2.jpg")
```

--

- Challenge: operationalising this data

--

- Needs to be provided in 'actionable' format

--

- Requires skills + infrastructure

---

## A case study of an actionable tool: [w](http://npct0.vs.mythic-beasts.com/shiny_interface/?r=west-yorkshire)[ww.pct.bike](www.pct.bike)

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The front page of the open source, open access Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT).", out.width="80%"}

```

## Building the web application

- Started by writing various messy scripts

But soon that became unsustainable

---

## Developing stplanr

- With support from colleagues in LIDA I created **stplanr**, which works like this (after you have installed R):

```{r}
library(stplanr)
r = route_cyclestreet(
  from = "Chapeltown, Leeds",
  to = "University of Leeds"
  )
r
```

---

## Visualising the results

.pull-left[


- Thanks to existing open source tools for visualisation, we can plot this, e.g. with:

```{r}
library(leaflet)
m = leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  addPolylines(data = r) %>% 
  addMiniMap() %>% 
  addScaleBar()
```

]

.pull-right[

```{r, out.width="100%", out.height="400"}
m
```

]
---

## Capabilities of stplanr

.pull-left[

- Convert origin-destination pairs into geographic lines

Example datasets in **stplanr**

Centroids (open access data):

```{r}
head(cents_sf[1], 3)
```

]

.pull-right[

### Origin-destination (OD) pairs

```{r}
head(flow[c(1:3)], 2)
```

]

---

## Making tabular data spatial


Conversion to a spatial object with **stplanr**


```{r}
l = od2line(flow, cents_sf)
sf:::plot.sf(l[3:5], lwd = l$All / mean(l$All))
```

---

## Interactive visualisation is key

.pull-left[


- Previous plot is not particularly revealing 

- Another visualisation will help

```{r}
library(tmap)
l$pwalk = l$On.foot / l$All
m2 = tm_shape(l) +
  tm_lines(
    "pwalk",
    lwd = "All",
    scale = 10,
    palette = "RdYlBu")
```

]

.pull-right[

- Make the data come alive

```{r, out.width="100%", out.height=400, message=FALSE}
tmap_leaflet(m2)
```

]

> The â€˜Propensity to Cycle Toolâ€™ shows that if residents of Greater Manchester were as likely to cycle as the Dutch we would increase commuter journeys ten-fold, leaving room on the road for people who had to drive. This level of cycling would lead to an estimated Â£1 billion per year saving to individuals and the local economy because of the resulting health benefits. (British Cyclingâ€™s chief executive, Julie Harrington, November 2017 see [britishcycling.org.uk](https://www.britishcycling.org.uk/campaigning/article/20171102-campaigning-news-British-Cycling-responds-to-Mayor-of-Greater-Manchester-Andy-Burham-s--congestion-conversation--0))

> City cycling czar Chris Boardman has unveiled plans for a thousand miles of interlinked bike and walking lanes across Greater Manchester. Dubbed â€˜Beelinesâ€™, the game-changing 10-year, Â£1.5bn proposal includes 75 miles of segregated cycle lanes similar to those found in Holland and Denmark ([Manchester Evening News](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/cycling-walking-lanes-greater-manchester-14832995))
