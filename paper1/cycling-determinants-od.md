<!-- # Introduction -->
<!-- The benefits of cycling for everyday trips are now well-established. -->
<!-- Uptake of active transport has been shown to improve health and environmental outcomes across a wide range of measures, notably x, y and z. -->
<!-- Cycling in particular has the potential to transform transport systems in densly populated urban areas because of the mode's speed and and thermodynamic efficiency compared to walking: -->
<!-- a much higher proportion of motorised trips currently made by motorised modes could be replaced by cycling than by walking. -->
<!-- The benefits of cycling uptake increase dramatically when new cycle trips replace trips that would have otherwise been made by car  -->
<!-- - Policy context and need [@celis-morales_association_2017] -->
<!-- - The fact it builds on the PCT [@lovelace_propensity_2017] -->
<!-- - Natural experiments with before/after [@heinen_changes_2015] [@prins_causal_2016] -->
<!-- - Impact on safety: [@reynolds_impact_2009] -->
<!-- - Categorisations of research into cycling/infrastructure relationship. Target group / trip type (commuting) / dependent variable / geographic level (person, area, school - suggested) - table -->
<!-- ## Area-level studies -->
<!-- [@parkin_estimation_2008] -->
<!-- ## Organisational level studies -->
<!-- ## Route level studies -->
<!-- In route level studies the main variable is at the route level. -->
<!-- Typically these studies involve a single new cycle path being constructed and the resulting change in behaviour being observed. -->
<!-- There is very strong evidence that *existing* cyclists respond to new routes [@heesch_evaluation_2016]. -->
<!-- ## Individual-level studies -->
<!-- - [@heinen_does_2017; @heinen_role_2011] -->
<!-- # Data and methods -->
<!-- # Computation -->
<!-- The method described in the previous section was implemented in the statistical programming language R [@rcoreteam_language_2017]. -->
<!-- - Description of the historic uptake script -->
<!-- - Rerunning with different parameters for sensitivity tests -->
<!-- # Results -->
<!-- # Conclusions -->
