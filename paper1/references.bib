  abstract = {Background
Mechanisms linking changes to the environment with changes in physical activity are poorly understood. Insights into mechanisms of interventions can help strengthen causal attribution and improve understanding of divergent response patterns. We examined the causal pathways linking exposure to new transport infrastructure with changes in cycling to work.
Methods
We used baseline (2009) and follow-up (2012) data (N = 469) from the Commuting and Health in Cambridge natural experimental study (Cambridge, UK). Exposure to new infrastructure in the form of the Cambridgeshire Guided Busway was defined using residential proximity. Mediators studied were changes in perceptions of the route to work, theory of planned behaviour constructs and self-reported use of the new infrastructure. Outcomes were modelled as an increase, decrease or no change in weekly cycle commuting time. We used regression analyses to identify combinations of mediators forming potential pathways between exposure and outcome. We then tested these pathways in a path model and stratified analyses by baseline level of active commuting.
Results
We identified changes in perceptions of the route to work, and use of the cycle path, as potential mediators. Of these potential mediators, only use of the path significantly explained (85\%) the effect of the infrastructure in increasing cycling. Path use also explained a decrease in cycling among more active commuters.
Conclusion
The findings strengthen the causal argument that changing the environment led to changes in health-related behaviour via use of the new infrastructure, but also show how some commuters may have spent less time cycling as a result.},

  abstract = {Getting people cycling is an increasingly common objective in transport planning institutions worldwide. A growing evidence base indicates that high quality infrastructure can boost local cycling rates. Yet for infrastructure and other cycling measures to be effective, it is important to intervene in the right places, such as along ‘desire lines’ of high latent demand. This creates the need for tools and methods to help answer the question ‘where to build?’. Following a brief review of the policy and research context related to this question, this paper describes the design, features and potential applications of such a tool. The Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT) is an online, interactive planning support system that was initially developed to explore and map cycling potential across England (see www.pct.bike). Based on origin-destination data it models cycling levels at area, desire line, route and route network levels, for current levels of cycling, and for scenario-based ‘cycling futures.’ Four scenarios are presented, including ‘Go Dutch’ and ‘Ebikes,’ which explore what would happen if English people had the same propensity to cycle as Dutch people and the potential impact of electric cycles on cycling uptake. The cost effectiveness of investment depends not only on the number of additional trips cycled, but on wider impacts such as health and carbon benefits. The PCT reports these at area, desire line, and route level for each scenario. The PCT is open source, facilitating the creation of scenarios and deployment in new contexts. We conclude that the PCT illustrates the potential of online tools to inform transport decisions and raises the wider issue of how models should be used in transport planning.},

  abstract = {Intervention studies suggest that changing the built environment may encourage a modal shift from car travel towards active travel. However, little is known about the detail of patterns of changes in travel behaviour. Adult commuters working in Cambridge (UK) completed annual questionnaires between 2009 and 2012. Commuting was assessed using a validated seven-day travel-to-work record. The intervention consisted of the opening of a guided busway with a path for walking and cycling in 2011. Exposure to the intervention was defined as the negative of the square root of the shortest road distance from home to the busway. We investigated the association between exposure to the intervention and specific modal shifts and patterns of change, along with individual mode choice patterns over the entire four-year period. Five groups of patterns of change were found in our in-depth explorations: (1) no change, (2) a full modal shift, (3) a partial modal shift, (4) non-stable but patterned behaviour, and (5) complicated or apparently random patterns. A minority of participants had a directed change of either a full modal shift or, more commonly, a partial modal shift, whereas a large proportion showed a highly variable pattern. No significant associations were found between exposure to the intervention and specific modal shifts or patterns of change. Our analyses revealed a large diversity in (changes in) travel behaviour patterns over time, and showed that the intervention did not result in one specific pattern of behaviour change or produce only full modal shifts. These insights are important for improving the measurement of travel behaviour, improving our understanding of how changes in travel behaviour patterns occur, and fully capturing the potential impacts of interventions.},

  abstract = {Bicycle infrastructure is being constructed in Australia to encourage safer and faster cycling trips. However, there has been limited evaluation of the impact of infrastructure investments. This study examined the behavioural impact of a new segment of a dedicated bikeway (Veloway 1 [V1] Stage C) that links southern suburbs with Brisbane city centre. The V1 Stage C opened in June, 2013. Cyclists who used a pre-existing shared path that links southern suburbs with the city centre completed an intercept survey pre- and post-V1 Stage C opening. Cyclists who used the V1 Stage C after it opened completed the same survey at the same time post-V1 Stage C opening. Survey data were complemented by GPS bicycle count data from cyclists riding on the main cycle routes into the city centre from southern suburbs: the V1 Stage C, the pre-existing shared path and a major arterial road. Survey data showed that pre- to post-V1 Stage C opening, average bicycle trip distance of cyclists using the shared path decreased (p=0.002), and the main catchment area of that path narrowed to suburbs to the west of it (p$<$0.001). Compared to cyclists using the shared path post-V1 Stage C opening, those using the V1 were travelling longer distances (p=0.02) and were more committed to making their trip by bicycle (p=0.001). The GPS bicycle counts increased monthly on the V1 Stage C after it opened (p$<$0.002). GPS bicycle counts on the alternative routes did not change (p=0.84). There were greater increases in monthly counts of cyclists approaching Brisbane from the south post-V1 Stage C opening than pre-opening. The findings suggest that veloways like the V1 can attract cyclists travelling from outer suburbs into a city centre.},
